I’m developing numerical methods and models for data assimilation and
 uncertainty quantification particularly for applications in
  engineering and environmental/weather forecast.

Currently, I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Mathematics for Uncertainty Quantification, Department of Mathematics, at the RWTH Aachen University, Germany.

I acquired PhD degree in applied sciences at University of Liège in Belgium and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Scientific Computing, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Germany.
