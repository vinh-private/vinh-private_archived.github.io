Last semester,  I took in teaching activities
 of the course [Mathematics 2 for mechanical engineers][math-2]
  at the [RWTH-Aachen university][rwth-aachen].





With more than **2000 students**, this is a considerable challenge.
 Moreover, this is the first time we
  are responsible for such a significant course.

My key responsibility is leading a team in developing **digital exams**
 and **exercises**. Digitization is crucial for a two-thousand-student-course.

| *Some feedback from students.* |





The course has been running smoothly, and feedback from students
 is encouraging, in particular on the aspect of electronic exercises.





  Next semester, I will participate also in teaching
  the course Mathematics 3 for mechanical engineers
   at RWTH-Aachen University, and we are warming up for new challenges.
